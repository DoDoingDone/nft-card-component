learning responsive design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm still very new at implementing my study into actual web design. I'm learning quickly where my weak points in css are, especially in flexbox and mobile-first design. Luckily, this challenge looks much the same on most screen sizes.

I'm most proud using basic custom properties. It's a small step, but I can see how it will really help in larger projects.

### Continued development

Being new, my goals are getting a solid grasp of flexbox, css grid, and writing out clean, semantic code.

I looked up quite a bit of help on YouTube. The biggest challenge for me is realizing people do things differently, and to just pick a path and go forward with it.
